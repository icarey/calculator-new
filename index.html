                Worries about droughts and <a href="http://grist.org/article/americas-hidden-water-affordability-crisis/">water crises</a> have left many wondering how to conserve water.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Human beings need less than a gallon of water each day to survive. But factor in the necessities of modern living, like showering, cooking and cleaning, and that number quickly multiples.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In fact, the average American uses between <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/qa-home-percapita.html">80 and 100 gallons</a> of water per day. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water#Daily%20Life">Seventy percent</a> of that
                water is used in the home, to flush the toilet, take a shower and wash your clothes, among other things. In a month, that’s enough h2o for each person to fill a small swimming pool.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <aside class="pquote">
                <blockquote>
                    “We already withdraw a lot more water than our ecosystem can handle. There is a lot of evidence that we should conserve water for future generations.”
                </blockquote>
            </aside>
            <br>
            <p>A few years ago, researchers at the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-science-how-much-water-nations-consume/">University of Twente</a> in the Netherlands found that domestically the U.S. has the highest level of
                water consumption per capita on the planet; each American consumes more than 457,000 gallons of water a year. A more comprehensive study by the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/watuse/wuto.html">U.S. Geological Survey</a> estimated that
                the entire nation consumes around 355 million gallons of water a day.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>“There’s a water crisis,” said Dr. Kelly Kibler, who has a Ph.D. in water resources engineering. “We already withdraw a lot more water than our ecosystem can handle. There is a lot of evidence that we should conserve water for future generations.”</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Most Americans take access to clean water for granted. In some parts of African people use less than 10 gallons of water per day — that’s less water than most Americans use just to shower. But image not having access to running water. How
                would you brush your teeth or enjoy a cup of tea? Could you survive even a day without water?</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b id="tip">Turn off the faucet.</b> Basic stuff but we’re all guilty from time to time. Instead of mindlessly letting the water run while you brush your teeth, wash your face or shave, turn it off. This simple act will save five gallons
                    of water. </li>
                <br>
                <li><b id="tip">Resist half-loads of laundry.</b> While it might be tempting because you are dying to wear your favorite pair of jeans, half loads of laundry can still use up to 30 gallons of water per load — and that is with energy-efficient
                    machines. Call it a laundry day and wear something else.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b id="tip">Invest in water-efficient appliances.</b> Dr. Kibler recommends low-flow shower heads that integrate air in the water. “They allow you to enjoy the same length shower but use less water.”</li>
                <br>
                <li><b id="tip">Don’t squander water.</b> Got a half-full glass of water that’s gone stale? Use it on a house plant. Boil some water for that pasta dinner? Let it cool and use it to scrub your floor. It doesn’t matter how you use it, be creative
                    — just don’t throw it away. “Try not to waste food,” Kibler said. “When food is wasted, the resources used to produce the food are also wasted.” </li>
